# Full-Stack Web Application

This project is a full-stack web application combining a React and Redux frontend with an Express.js and MongoDB backend. It supports user authentication, error handling, file uploads, and more. This main README provides an overview of the entire project and links to the detailed README files for individual components.

## Project Overview
- **Frontend**: Built with React, Redux, React Router, and Tailwind CSS. It implements user authentication, pagination, and news content display.
- **Backend**: Built with Express.js, Mongoose, Cloudinary, and other popular libraries. It handles user authentication, error handling, and database interactions.
- **Database**: Uses MongoDB for persistent data storage.
- **Environment Variables**: Uses `dotenv` to manage sensitive configuration parameters.
- **Error Handling**: Includes custom error handling middleware in the backend.
- **File Uploads**: Supports file uploads for user avatars and other features.
- **Cloud Storage**: Integrates with Cloudinary for media storage and retrieval.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- A Cloudinary account for cloud storage (optional)

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/102vansh/signupscreen.git
   
   ```

2. **Install Frontend and Backend Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the frontend and backend directories, and install their respective dependencies.
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
   Configure environment variables for both frontend and backend. Create `.env` files in the appropriate locations with required parameters such as `PORT`, `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, etc.

### Running the Application
1. **Start the Backend Server**:
   In the backend directory, start the Express server.
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend Server**:
   In the frontend directory, start the React development server.
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the Application**:
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5173/` to view the frontend. The backend typically runs on a different port (e.g., `http://signupscreen-6.onrender.com/`).

## Detailed README Files
Each section of the project has a dedicated README with more information:

- [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md): Details about the React frontend, including routing, Redux state management, and component structure.
- [Backend README](./backend/README.md): Describes the Express.js backend, including database connections, error handling, and user authentication.

## Contributions and Collaboration
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a personal copy of the project.
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes.
3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Describe your changes and submit a pull request for review.

## Notes and Recommendations
- **Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
- **Security**: Apply best practices for security, including input validation, JWT token handling, and data encryption.
- **Deployment**: For production deployment, consider using a platform like Heroku, AWS, or Vercel.

## Conclusion
This full-stack project provides a solid foundation for building web applications with React and Express. It supports user authentication, error handling, and various features for a modern web application. Use the links above for detailed information on each component.

# Backend README

This README provides an overview of the backend component for the full-stack web application. The backend is built with Express.js and MongoDB, and it handles user authentication, error handling, and database interactions.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Supports user registration, login, password change, and password reset.
- **Error Handling**: Includes a custom error middleware for centralized error handling.
- **File Uploads**: Supports file uploads for user avatars and other data.
- **Cloudinary Integration**: Integrates with Cloudinary for cloud-based media storage.
- **Environment Variables**: Uses `dotenv` to manage sensitive configuration parameters.

## Technologies Used
- **Express.js**: A popular Node.js framework for building web applications.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object-Document Mapping) library for MongoDB.
- **Cloudinary**: A cloud-based media management platform.
- **bcrypt**: A library for hashing and comparing passwords.
- **jsonwebtoken**: For generating JWT tokens for user authentication.
- **crypto**: A library for generating secure random values and hashes.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.

## Project Structure
### Routes
- **User Routes**: Handles user-related operations like registration, login, and password reset.
- **Error Handling**: Custom middleware to handle errors globally.
- **File Uploads**: Supports multipart form data for file uploads.

### Middleware
- **JSON Parsing**: Parses incoming requests with JSON bodies.
- **URL-Encoded Parsing**: Parses URL-encoded bodies.
- **Error Middleware**: Custom middleware to handle errors throughout the application.

### Cloudinary Setup
Configures Cloudinary with credentials from environment variables to support cloud-based media storage.

### User Schema
Defines a Mongoose schema for users, including attributes like `name`, `email`, `password`, and `avatar`.

### Error Handling
Custom error class (`ErrorHandler`) and middleware (`errormiddleware`) to handle errors and send appropriate responses.

## Getting Started
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you've installed the required Node.js packages.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   Set up environment variables in a `.env` file. Key variables include:
   - `PORT`: The port on which the server runs.
   - `MONGO_URI`: The connection string for MongoDB.
   - `JWT_SECRET`: The secret key for JWT token generation.
   - `CLOUD_NAME`, `API_KEY`, `API_SECRET`: Credentials for Cloudinary.

3. **Run the Server**:
   Start the backend server.
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Notes and Recommendations
- **Security**: Ensure proper security measures, such as hashing passwords and using JWT tokens.
- **Database Connection**: Ensure the MongoDB database is running and accessible.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to catch and respond to errors gracefully.

## Conclusion
The backend component for this full-stack application provides user authentication, file uploads, and error handling. It integrates with MongoDB for persistent data storage and Cloudinary for cloud-based media storage. Be sure to follow best practices for security and error handling when deploying in a production environment.
