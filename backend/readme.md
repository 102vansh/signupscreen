<!-- # Express.js Backend with File Upload, Cloudinary, and Error Handling

This project sets up a basic Express.js server with support for file upload, cloud storage with Cloudinary, CORS, and custom error handling. The server loads environment variables from a configuration file and connects to a database. It includes user-related routes and a middleware for error handling.

## Features
- **Express Server**: The base framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **Environment Variables**: Uses `dotenv` to manage configuration parameters.
- **CORS Support**: Enables cross-origin resource sharing with specified origins.
- **File Upload**: Supports file uploads with `express-fileupload`.
- **Cloudinary Integration**: Allows for file storage and retrieval with Cloudinary.
- **Custom Error Handling**: Middleware for handling errors throughout the application.
- **User Routes**: Handles user-related operations like registration, login, etc.

## Technologies Used
- **Express.js**: A popular framework for building Node.js applications.
- **dotenv**: A package for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **cors**: A package to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
- **express-fileupload**: A middleware for handling file uploads.
- **Cloudinary**: A cloud-based media management platform.
- **Custom Middleware**: For handling errors.

## Project Structure
### Server Setup
- **Express Initialization**: Creates an Express app.
- **Environment Variables**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **Database Connection**: Establishes a connection to the database (code not shown).
- **File Upload Setup**: Configures `express-fileupload` to handle temporary files.
- **CORS Configuration**: Enables CORS for specific origins.
- **Cloudinary Configuration**: Configures Cloudinary with credentials from environment variables.

### Middleware
- **JSON Parsing**: Parses incoming requests with JSON bodies.
- **URL-Encoded Parsing**: Parses URL-encoded bodies.
- **Custom Error Middleware**: Handles errors across the application.

### Routes
- **User Routes**: A separate router handles user-related operations. This router is mounted at `/api/v1/user`.
- **Additional Routes**: Add more routes as needed.

### Start the Server
- Listens on the specified port and outputs a message confirming the server is running.

## Setup and Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone this repository to your local environment.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/102vansh/signupscreen.git
   cd /backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install all required Node.js packages.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following information:
   - `PORT`: The port on which the server will run.
   - `CLOUD_NAME`, `API_KEY`, `API_SECRET`: Credentials for Cloudinary.
   - Other environment variables as needed.

4. **Run the Server**:
   Start the Express server.
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Test the Application**:
   Use a tool like Postman or cURL to test the various endpoints.

## Notes and Recommendations
- **Database Connection**: Ensure the database connection is properly configured in the project (code not shown).
- **Security Considerations**: Consider additional security measures such as input validation, rate limiting, and authentication.
- **Cloudinary Usage**: Make sure to configure Cloudinary with the correct credentials.
- **Environment Management**: Keep sensitive information out of version control by using environment variables.

## Conclusion
This setup provides a foundation for building an Express.js server with support for file uploads, cloud storage, CORS, and error handling. It can be extended to include additional routes, middleware, and features to suit specific project requirements. -->

## Overview
The backend is built with Express.js and MongoDB, and it integrates with Cloudinary for cloud-based media storage. Key functionalities include user authentication, error handling, and file uploads.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Supports user registration, login, password change, and password reset.
- **Error Handling**: Includes custom error handling middleware for centralized error handling.
- **File Uploads**: Supports file uploads for user avatars and other data.
- **Cloudinary Integration**: Integrates with Cloudinary for media storage.
- **Database Connection**: Connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.

## Technologies Used
- **Express.js**: A popular Node.js framework for building web applications.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object-Document Mapping) library for MongoDB.
- **Cloudinary**: A cloud-based media management platform.
- **bcrypt**: A library for hashing and comparing passwords.
- **jsonwebtoken**: For generating JWT tokens for user authentication.
- **crypto**: For generating secure random values and hashes.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.

## Project Structure
The backend project contains the following key components:

- **Routes**: Defines the routes for user-related operations like registration, login, and password reset.
- **Middleware**: Includes custom middleware for error handling and JSON parsing.
- **Schema**: Defines the Mongoose schema for user-related operations.
- **Error Handling**: Custom error handling middleware and error classes.
- **Cloudinary Setup**: Configuration for Cloudinary integration.

## Getting Started
To run the backend, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file with the required configuration parameters, such as `PORT`, `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `CLOUD_NAME`, `API_KEY`, `API_SECRET`.

3. **Run the Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Notes and Recommendations
- **Security**: Ensure proper security measures, such as password hashing and JWT tokens.
- **Database Connection**: Confirm that MongoDB is running and accessible.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage errors gracefully.
