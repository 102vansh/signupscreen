## Overview
The backend is built with Express.js and MongoDB, and it integrates with Cloudinary for cloud-based media storage. Key functionalities include user authentication, error handling, and file uploads.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Supports user registration, login, password change, and password reset.
- **Error Handling**: Includes custom error handling middleware for centralized error handling.
- **File Uploads**: Supports file uploads for user avatars and other data.
- **Cloudinary Integration**: Integrates with Cloudinary for media storage.
- **Database Connection**: Connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.

## Technologies Used
- **Express.js**: A popular Node.js framework for building web applications.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object-Document Mapping) library for MongoDB.
- **Cloudinary**: A cloud-based media management platform.
- **bcrypt**: A library for hashing and comparing passwords.
- **jsonwebtoken**: For generating JWT tokens for user authentication.
- **crypto**: For generating secure random values and hashes.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.

## Project Structure
The backend project contains the following key components:

- **Routes**: Defines the routes for user-related operations like registration, login, and password reset.
- **Middleware**: Includes custom middleware for error handling and JSON parsing.
- **Schema**: Defines the Mongoose schema for user-related operations.
- **Error Handling**: Custom error handling middleware and error classes.
- **Cloudinary Setup**: Configuration for Cloudinary integration.

## Getting Started
To run the backend, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file with the required configuration parameters, such as `PORT`, `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `CLOUD_NAME`, `API_KEY`, `API_SECRET`.

3. **Run the Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Notes and Recommendations
- **Security**: Ensure proper security measures, such as password hashing and JWT tokens.
- **Database Connection**: Confirm that MongoDB is running and accessible.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage errors gracefully.

## Additional Documentation
Here are links to other README files within the backend folder for more details:

- [Model README](../models/README.md): Provides information on connecting to MongoDB and configuring the database.
- [Error Handling README](./middleware/README.md): Details the custom error handling mechanism used in the backend.
- [Routes README](./route/README.md): Describes the user-related routes and operations.
- [Controllers README](./controllers/README.md): Describes the user-related routes and operations.

## Conclusion
This backend provides user authentication, error handling, and file uploads, integrating with MongoDB and Cloudinary. For more information, explore the additional documentation linked above. When deploying to production, ensure proper security measures and robust error handling.
