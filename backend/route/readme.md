# User Authentication and Account Management API

This project defines routes for user authentication and account management using Express.js. It includes endpoints for user registration, login, password change, and password reset.

## Features
- **User Registration**: Allows new users to create accounts.
- **User Login**: Provides authentication for existing users.
- **Forgot Password**: Initiates a password reset process for users who forgot their password.
- **Change Password**: Allows users to change their password using a token.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: The JavaScript runtime.
- **Express.js**: A popular framework for building web applications and APIs in Node.js.

## Routes Overview
### POST `/register`
- **Description**: Creates a new user account.
- **Request Body**: 
  - `name`: The user's name.
  - `email`: The user's email address.
  - `password`: The user's password.
- **Response**: 
  - On success, returns a JSON object indicating successful registration and possibly user data.
  - On failure, returns an appropriate error message.

### POST `/login`
- **Description**: Authenticates a user and provides a session or token.
- **Request Body**:
  - `email`: The user's email address.
  - `password`: The user's password.
- **Response**:
  - On success, returns a JSON object with authentication information (e.g., JWT token).
  - On failure, returns an appropriate error message.

### POST `/forgotpassword`
- **Description**: Initiates the password reset process for users who forgot their password.
- **Request Body**:
  - `email`: The email address associated with the user's account.
- **Response**:
  - On success, returns a message indicating that password reset instructions have been sent.
  - On failure, returns an error message.

### PUT `/changepassword/:token`
- **Description**: Allows users to change their password using a reset token.
- **Request Body**:
  - `password`: The new password.
- **Route Parameter**:
  - `token`: The token sent to the user for password reset.
- **Response**:
  - On success, returns a message indicating the password has been changed.
  - On failure, returns an error message.

## How to Use
1. **Install Dependencies**:

   npm install express
   ```

2. **Set Up Express Application**:
   Create an Express application and use the provided routes.
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const userRoutes = require('./path/to/your/router');
   
   const app = express();
   app.use(express.json()); // For parsing JSON requests
   app.use('/api/users', userRoutes); // Mount the user routes
   
   app.listen(3000, () => {
     console.log('Server running on port 3000');
   });
   ```

3. **Implement Controllers**:
   Ensure you have implemented the controller functions (`register`, `login`, `changepassword`, `forgotpassword`) to handle the business logic for each route.

4. **Secure Your Routes**:
   Consider implementing middleware for authentication and authorization to secure sensitive endpoints.

5. **Run and Test**:
   Start your Express application and test each endpoint to ensure proper functionality. Use tools like Postman or cURL for testing.

## Conclusion
This setup provides a basic structure for user authentication and account management in an Express.js application. It includes endpoints for user registration, login, password change, and password reset. Additional security measures, like token-based authentication and input validation, should be considered for a production-ready application.
